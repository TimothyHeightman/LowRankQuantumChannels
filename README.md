# LowRankQuantumChannels
Repo for the publicly available code for our paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14608).

All the code written to produce plots in our manuscript can be found in the single
mathematica file contained in this repo. It contains the Sinkhorn-like algorithm
and an anayltical algorithm for reducing the Kraus rank of a generic quantum channel
from d^2 to d (the theoretical minimum) when measuring outcomes in a single projective
basis.
